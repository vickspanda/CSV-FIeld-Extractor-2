# CSV Field Extractor

## Overview

This program allows you to extract specific fields from a CSV file based on multiple user-specified conditions in sequence. It filters the data step-by-step and generates intermediate CSV files for each condition, finally producing a text file (`outFile.txt`) with the desired output field.

## Features

- **Flexible Condition Filtering**: You can filter data based on any combination of Roll No, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Gender, Year, and Degree.
- **Condition Order Preservation**: Conditions are evaluated in the order specified by the user.
- **CSV Input**: The program processes data from a CSV file where fields are structured as `RollNo, FirstName MiddleName LastName, Gender, Year, Degree`.
- **Sequential filtering**: Conditions are applied one after another, generating intermediate filtered CSV files.
- **Final result output**: The final result is saved in `outFile.txt`, containing the desired field after all conditions are satisfied.

## How It Works

1. **Condition Specification**: The user specifies filtering conditions (e.g., Degree, Gender, Year) via command-line arguments.
2. **Field Output**: After specifying the conditions, the user provides the field they want to extract, such as the First Name of students matching the conditions.
3. **CSV Structure**: The program assumes the CSV file follows the format:

   ```csv
   RollNo, FirstName MiddleName LastName, Gender, Year, Degree
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., gcc) installed.
- A CSV file containing data in the format mentioned above.

## Program Syntax

```bash
./extractField <csv-file> <field1> <value1> <field2> <value2> ... -print <fieldx>
```

### Example

To extract the **First Names** of students with:

- **Degree**: MSc
- **Gender**: Female (F)
- **Year**: 2024

Use the command:

```bash
./extractField student.csv -d MSc -g F -y 2024 -print -fn
```

### Program Flow
1. **Validation**:
   - Check that the input file has the `.csv` extension.
   - Ensure the correct number of arguments is provided.
   - Validate the fields and print operations.

2. **Filtering Logic**:
   - For each condition, a new CSV file is generated by applying the filtering criteria to the previously filtered data.
   - This continues until all conditions are applied.

3. **Output**:
   - Once all conditions are satisfied, the program extracts the desired field and writes it to `outFile.txt`.

### File Handling
The program generates intermediate CSV files (e.g., `temp1.csv`, `temp2.csv`) for each filtering condition. These temporary files are used internally to narrow down the dataset until the final output is produced.

## Field and Condition Keywords

You have to use the following keywords to specify fields and conditions in the command-line arguments:

| Keyword | Field         |
|---------|---------------|
| `-r`    | Roll No       |
| `-fn`   | First Name    |
| `-mn`   | Middle Name   |
| `-ln`   | Last Name     |
| `-g`    | Gender        |
| `-y`    | Year          |
| `-d`    | Degree        |
| `-print`| Print Field   |

### Important Notes:
- **Conditions**: You can specify any combination of fields as conditions.
- **Print Field**: Only one field can be specified for output using the `-print` option, and must be mentioned in the last.
- **Order of Conditions**: The program evaluates the conditions in the order they are provided.
  
## Error Handling

The program performs the following validations:

1. **CSV File Extension**: The input file must have a `.csv` extension.
2. **Number of Arguments**: The command should have a valid number of arguments. Invalid argument counts will result in an error message.
3. **Field Validation**: The program checks whether the specified field keywords are valid. If not, it returns an error.

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Compilation**: 

   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Execution**:

   Example of running the program to filter students with `MSc` degree, `F` gender, and `2024` year, extracting their first names:

   ```bash
   ./extractField student.csv -d MSc -g F -y 2024 -print -fn
   ```
