## Project Title: CSV Field Extraction Based on User-Specified Conditions

### Introduction
This program allows you to extract specific fields from a CSV file based on multiple user-specified conditions in sequence. It filters the data step-by-step and generates intermediate CSV files for each condition, finally producing a text file (`outFile.txt`) with the desired output field.

### Features
- **Condition-based filtering**: Apply conditions on fields such as Degree, Gender, Year, etc.
- **Sequential filtering**: Conditions are applied one after another, generating intermediate filtered CSV files.
- **Final result output**: The final result is saved in `outFile.txt`, containing the desired field after all conditions are satisfied.

### Example Use Case
Suppose you want to extract all the **first names** of students where:
1. **Degree** is MSc,
2. **Gender** is Female (F),
3. **Year** is 2024.

The program will:
1. Filter all rows where the degree is MSc and save them in a new CSV file.
2. From this file, filter the rows where gender is F and save it in another file.
3. Further filter by year (2024) and produce the final output with the first names in `outFile.txt`.

### Assumptions
- The input CSV file is structured with the following fields:
  ```
  RollNo, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, Gender, Year, Degree
  ```
  **No extra spaces** are allowed in the CSV file.
  
- The program only supports one field to be printed in the output at a time.

### Keywords for Fields
- `-r`: Roll No
- `-fn`: First Name
- `-mn`: Middle Name
- `-ln`: Last Name
- `-g`: Gender
- `-y`: Year
- `-d`: Degree

### Command-Line Syntax
To run the program, use the following syntax in the terminal:

```
$ make
$ ./extractField <your-csv-file> <field1> <value1> <field2> <value2> ... -print <field-to-print>
```

#### Parameters:
- `<your-csv-file>`: The CSV file you want to process.
- `<field>`: The keyword for the field (e.g., `-r` for Roll No, `-fn` for First Name, etc.).
- `<value>`: The value to match for the specified field.
- `-print`: Specifies which field you want to output in the final result (`outFile.txt`).

#### Example Command:
To extract all first names where Degree is MSc, Gender is Female, and Year is 2024:
```
$ ./extractField students.csv -d MSc -g F -y 2024 -print -fn
```

### Program Flow
1. **Validation**:
   - Check that the input file has the `.csv` extension.
   - Ensure the correct number of arguments is provided.
   - Validate the fields and print operations.

2. **Filtering Logic**:
   - For each condition, a new CSV file is generated by applying the filtering criteria to the previously filtered data.
   - This continues until all conditions are applied.

3. **Output**:
   - Once all conditions are satisfied, the program extracts the desired field and writes it to `outFile.txt`.

### File Handling
The program generates intermediate CSV files (e.g., `temp1.csv`, `temp2.csv`) for each filtering condition. These temporary files are used internally to narrow down the dataset until the final output is produced.

### Error Handling
- **Invalid number of arguments**: If the number of arguments is not as expected, the program outputs: `Error: Invalid Number of Arguments`.
- **Invalid fields or conditions**: If an unrecognized field is passed, it outputs: `Error: Invalid Fields Passed`.
- **Missing or incorrect CSV file**: If the CSV file is missing or does not have the `.csv` extension, it outputs: `Error: .csv File is expected as an Input`.

### Conclusion
This program efficiently filters CSV data based on user-defined conditions and provides a simple way to extract specific fields into a final text file. It can be useful for various data analysis tasks where filtering and extracting specific data is needed.
